This is the code for the paper "Distribution-free and model-free multivariate feature screening via multivariate rank distance correlation", in this .py file I only include code to generate our method, and 2 illustration simulations using our method.
If you need the full code with all simulation studies in the paper, please feel free to reach out to me.
